Did you know it's possible to run Proprietary Nvidia drivers AND use Intel Integrated Graphics® to display the desktop?

Yeah. You just have to install the Nvidia drivers on a desktop and then go into the BIOS, enable the integrated graphics, and then set it as default video output. Then, just plug your video cable directly into the motherboard.

Do this, then you'll have the whole GPU to throw at your OpenCL and Tensorflow stuff. Congrats.

I had to do this at work last week, so I'm just gonna toss this up on here.
