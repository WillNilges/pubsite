I"Ö<p>So, if you‚Äôve read my aboutme page recently, you‚Äôll know that I‚Äôm currently working on putting together a cool custom controller for a GDD project for Imagine RIT 2020. Basically, the controller is going to be totally custom and will have many buttons, knobs, switches, dials, and displays so that people can walk by our booth and press fancy buttons to make random stuff happen in our game. (It‚Äôs more of a control panel, really). Basically, the panel will have the ability to impact the game world by activating abilities, changing stuff like gravity, screen orientation, etc. I want to make this happen by basically engineering a custom chassis, stuffing a bunch of really neat-o looking buttons inside, and having some kind of controller emulate keypresses</p>

<p>Only one problem, though: Embedded platforms are kind of a nightmare.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm writing about this becuase I know some people I think‚Äôd get a kick out of this story, and I think it‚Äôs really going to be an example of just how goddamn annoying computers can be.</p>

<p>Okay, so here‚Äôs the thing. I need a microcontroller board that can do all the things I needed it to do. I believe the best thing for this project would be an Arduino Leonardo, since it can do all the Arduino-y things, but can also be used as an HID device, meaning keyboard emulation. However, I didn‚Äôt want to use something I was familiar with (in persuit of knowledge‚Ñ¢). My original thought was to use the Teensy 3.6 that CSH had. However, when I went to the research room a few weeks ago to look for it, I couldn‚Äôt find it for the life of me! So, I had to look for alternatives.</p>

<p>I researched two of them: The Arduino has a project called HoodLoader2 that operated on the fact that Arduinos (I think all of them) actually have two microcontrollers on them. The Arduino Uno has a 16u2 and an ATmega328. The important thing to me was that HoodLoader2 enabled the user to program the 16u2, which enabled the use of any Arduino as an HID device (like a keyboard). I didn‚Äôt really want to do this, since it was Arduino.</p>

<p>So, I had another option: I remembered that I got a neat board from one of my friends called the FRDM-K64F. This board is a low-cost, open source microcontroller platform that (apparently) is used in the automotive industry. The reason I went after this board was that I found a HID library for it and was like, ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt have a Leonardo (which is the coward‚Äôs way out) or a Teensy so I‚Äôll try using this.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Boy, was that a fucking mistake.</strong></p>

<p>This K64F was a total blunder, and to this day I haven‚Äôt actually gotten it to work. Granted, I did learn a lot, but no actual results. TLDR is I‚Äôm convinced that I‚Äôve got the wrong firmware, but here‚Äôs the full story:</p>

<p>So the K64F is a board previously used in CMPE-460, Interface and Digital Electronics, which covers various topics related to sensors, motors, and signals that now uses the NXP Kinetis. At some point, a CSH alum got her hands on one of these boards, gave it away to another CSH‚Äôer, who gave it to me. Having not worked with this platform before, I immediately started googling everything, and stumbled upon mbed‚Äôs site. Mbed is a platform that allows easy programming and use of a <em>ton</em> of different microcontrollers. It‚Äôs possible to program the FRDM-K64F in a few different ways, but the way I wanted to do it was mbed.</p>
