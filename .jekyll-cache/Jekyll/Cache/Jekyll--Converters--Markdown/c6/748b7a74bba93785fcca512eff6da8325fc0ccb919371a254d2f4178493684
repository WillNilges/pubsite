<p>Hello! I'm Will Nilges, Computer Engineering major and Linux fanatic. Literally whenever I have freetime, I'm spending it coding, devving on some kind of microcontroller, or debugging (especially that last one). I'm proficient in C, C++, C#, Python, and Java.</p>
<p class="sectionHeaders">What I'm working on</p>
<p>This summer, I'm Co-Oping at Mastodon Design in Rochester, NY doing testing and embedded systems programming in C++ and Python.
    <br /><br />
    This semester, I'm taking:
    <ul>
        <li>Digital System Design II (CMPE-260)</li>
        <li>Differential Equations (MATH-231)</li>
        <li>Linear Algebra(MATH-241)</li>
        <li>Spanish for Science and Technology (MLSP-410)</li>
        <li>and an independent study where I'll be experimenting with the OLPC (IGME-599)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    As for the fun stuff, I have several projects in the works.
</p>
<p><strong>Directional AC</strong></p>
<p>Directional AC is a project I worked on for Imagine RIT 2019 as part of a bigger smart-car project made by CSH. The project helps to complete our concept of the interior of a futuristic car we've dubbed the Computerized Autonomous Roadster (CAR). It involves enabling the fans in a car's AC system to track a passenger and adjust its direction, power, and temperature using a 3D-printed bracket and camera setup.</p>

<p>The project is currently capable of tracking a passenger's face accurately and adjusting direction. I'm going to continue work on it to add more features and refine the bracket. Follow development <a href="https://github.com/willnilges/directionalac">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BetterVent</strong></p>
<p>BetterVent is a scheduling app I am developing for Computer Science House. We have tablets outside our special rooms that run this software. It displays the current time, which event is currently taking place, and which events are coming up. It also lets people make short, quick reservations for if they need to snag a room for a bit. Check on its progress and fork me <a href="https://www.github.com/willnilges/bettervent">here</a>.</p>

<p>Bettervent is open source, and you can find my repo on GitHub. You can also look at Reservator that I tried to fork from, but that app ended up being an overengineered undocumented nightmare, so I tossed everything out and started writing my own from scratch.
<br /><br />
Lately i've gotten busy making quality-of-life improvements to the UI and catching new and exciting bugs, but also adding the additional small feature here and there. At this point, I'd call BetterVent complete.  Check out the README for more information.</p>

<p><strong>The Death Panel</strong></p>
<p>The Death Panel is a control panel I'm currently in the process of prototyping for an Imagine RIT project that a bunch of Game Design majors are developing right now. The idea is that this panel will act as an "admin panel" for a given minigame that is currently being played. When you push a button, anything can happen! I aim to have it done fairly quickly, but it's an interesting little side project that I expect to evolve as the rest of the GDD project does. Follow development <a href="https://www.github.com/willnilges/deathpanel">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SampleZone</strong></p>
<p>
SampleZone is a command line mixer made by Steve Greene (sgreene570) I contribute to. It uses ncurses to allow for mixing and pitch shifting of audio files. There's a lot planned for this program, so stay tuned! Follow upstream development <a href="https://www.github.com/sgreene570/sampleZone">here</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>BOA</strong></p>
<p>BOA is a Unity game that I am currently developing in C#. It's a fast-paced, PVP, multiplayer shooter with a heavy focus on mobility and reaction time that drew a lot of inspiration from Terraria and OpenArena. Terraria PVP is a lot of fun in the 2D voxel-like environments that comprise that game, but I'd like it to be faster, and more focused on the combat. OpenArena is a lot like that, and also captures the general feel I want for the game.</p>
<p>I've had to put it on hold for a while as I focus on school, work, and my projects for CSH, but it'll (hopefully) be done by <s>mid 2019</s> 2020™.</p>
