<p>This weekend, I decided to pop open my blog to tweak and fix a few layout and organization things. To be able to quickly iterate, I quickly installed <code>httpd</code> on a development VM so that I could treat it like a real webserver and not just host it locally on my laptop.</p>
<p>Usually, when I do this, I use Ubuntu and Apache, which is pretty quick and simple to get running. Fedora, however, likes to be special, and use <code>httpd</code>. It also happens to have <code>firewalld</code>, which is a service I have experience with, but, I’ll admit, has been a while.</p>
<p>So I go to host the files, I change the configs and the ownership on the website files and everything, and I patch the firewall on the “Public” zone.</p>
<div class="codeBlock"><pre><code>$ sudo chown -R wilnil:apache /var/www/html
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https</code></pre></div>
<p>And, of course, it wouldn’t be a blog post if it worked, now would it?</p>
<p>No, for some reason this Fedora server didn’t much care for the Public Zone, and, in fact, it wasn’t even enabled, despite having services.</p>
<div class="codeBlock"><pre><code>$ sudo firewall-cmd --list-all-zones
public
  target: default
  icmp-block-inversion: no
  interfaces: 
  sources: 
  services: dhcpv6-client http https mdns ssh
  ports: 
  protocols: 
  masquerade: no
  forward-ports: 
  source-ports: 
  icmp-blocks: 
  rich rules:</code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, then, skippie. If you’re so smart, then what zones <em>are</em> active!?</p>
<div class="codeBlock"><pre><code>$ sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
FedoraServer
  interfaces: ens18</code></pre></div>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Well, then, uh…</p>
<div class="codeBlock"><pre><code>$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-service=http
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=FedoraServer --add-service=https</code></pre></div>
<p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Not sure if this is some kind of security risk, but for a quick dev server, it got the job done.</p>
