<p class="articleHeaders">Finishing ShelfLife... finally.</p>
<h3>11 May, 2020</h3>
<p>Yo, It’s been a while. The semester is finally over and I can finally pay attention to projects again. It’s been an unhealthy amount of time since I’ve touched anything :(</p>
<p>Anyway, today I’m looking into Kube/Openshift operators. I’ve realized that the best way to deploy ShelfLife on this cluster (or any cluster, for that matter) is to use an operator…</p>
<p>Duh.</p>
<p>This is actually old news, I knew that like 6 months ago, but now I’m going to try to implement it, I guess. For no particular reason.</p>
<p>Anyway, to do this, I think we need some .yaml files. Basically, from looking at the code of other operators, I think we need some yaml to create a service account, give it some role bindings (namely cluster roles) so it can touch all the levers in the cluster, and then… uhhh. I guess give it an API key or something. That part I’m still kind of fuzzy about.</p>
<p>But from reading this there is a nonzero chance that I had the right idea in the beginning. I am going to try to avoid going in circles like I did over winter break though.</p>
<p>But like, looking through these readmes on other projects, it’s more or less what I want.</p>
<p>Kube is hard.</p>
<p>So it looks like I might be able to actually construct this manually with <code>oc</code> commands, but we&#39;ll have to mess around with this some more. Also I have to remember how to use OpenShift. :L<br>So we also got this deployment.yaml file that I guess is used to actually stick the operator on the cluster. What an idea. I think I wanna poke at these roles again first. So lemme do that.
</p>
<p>For reference, here’s what cluster-admin looks like according to <code>oc describe clusterrole.rbac | less</code></p>
<pre><code>Name:         cluster-admin
Labels:       kubernetes.io/bootstrapping=rbac-defaults
Annotations:  authorization.openshift.io/system-only=true
              rbac.authorization.kubernetes.io/autoupdate=true
PolicyRule:
  Resources  Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
  ---------  -----------------  --------------  -----
  *.*        []                 []              [*]</code></pre>
<p>I think I just got it.</p>
<p>one of these two commands worked. (Actually, you just need the second one, pretty sure).</p>
<pre><code>oc policy add-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:default:shelflife-dev-bot
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:default:shelflife-dev-bot # This one works!</code></pre>
<p>Now, that’s not exactly what I want, since, well, it’s probably not good to shunt cluster-admins onto systems willie nilly. So, we gotta make a cluster role. I was messing around with a <code>shelflife</code> cluster role earlier in the year (Like, January). Here’s what it looks like according to <code>oc describe clusterrole.rbac | less</code>. To create this, use <code>oc create clusterrole shelflife --verb=get,watch,list,delete --resource=pods,namespaces,deployments,builds,buildconfigs,deploymentconfigs,deployments,podtemplates,projects</code>.</p>
<pre><code>Name:         shelflife
Labels:       &lt;none&gt;
Annotations:  &lt;none&gt;
PolicyRule:
  Resources                            Non-Resource URLs  Resource Names  Verbs
  ---------                            -----------------  --------------  -----
  namespaces                           []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  pods                                 []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  podtemplates                         []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  deploymentconfigs.apps.openshift.io  []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  buildconfigs.build.openshift.io      []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  builds.build.openshift.io            []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  deployments.extensions               []                 []              [get watch list delete]
  projects.project.openshift.io        []                 []              [get watch list delete]</code></pre>
<p>This does not work. However, when doing <code>oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:default:sl-test</code>, it works.</p>
<p>Groovy. so uhhhhhhhhh, what’s the deal? Well, I think we’re missing a resource. I’m not sure what, though, and I don’t know if I have a way to find out. I guess I could look at every API call the app needs to make…</p>
<p>However, that sounds boring. I think, for now, cluster-admin is workable. This is definitely not something I’m going to do for version 1.0, I just reeeeeallly want to make the app work, since I passed it as a major project. I need to find out how to make and use .yaml files to do all this cluster magic automatically.</p>
<p>Here are the commands you need to create a service account, give it sufficient permissions, and get a key to add to your <code>.env</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>oc create sa shelflife-dev-bot
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin system:serviceaccount:default:shelflife-dev-bot
oc get token shelflife-dev-bot</code></pre>
<p>I’ll just…. uhhhh…. add this to the README for now.</p>
<p>As I look through this code, it’s occurring to me that I need a bit more polish on this app. Actually, a bit is kind of an understatement. Please hold.</p>
