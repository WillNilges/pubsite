<p><strong>Directional AC</strong></p>
    <p>Directional AC is a project I worked on for Imagine RIT 2019 as part of a bigger smart-car project made by CSH. The project helps to complete our concept of the interior of a futuristic car we've dubbed the Computerized Autonomous Roadster (CAR). It involves enabling the fans in a car's AC system to track a passenger and adjust its direction, power, and temperature using a 3D-printed bracket and camera setup.</p>

    <p>The project is currently capable of tracking a passenger's face accurately and adjusting direction. I'm going to continue work on it to add more features and refine the bracket. Follow development <a href="https://github.com/willnilges/directionalac">here</a>.</p>
