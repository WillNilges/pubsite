## Hi, I'm Will! (he/him)

---

Computer Engineering major and Linux fanatic who plays _way_ too many tabletop games. In my freetime (in addition to unhealthy amounts of DND), I also do a lot of coding, 3D printing, fiction writing, digital art, and running. My favorite coding languages are C, Python, Rust, and BASH. I am also conversational in Spanish.

## What I'm working on

---

While finishing up my 5th and final year of a Computer Engineering degree at RIT, I've been exploring the CUDA language, particularly its applications in accelerating computer vision algorithms in OpenCV. You can find work on that [here](https://github.com/WillNilges/inkpath-cuda), which will hopefully eventually make its way to [Inkpath](https://github.com/WillNilges/inkpath/).

Being a senior in engineering, I'm also working on my senior design project with a group of really smart people. We're trying to build our own fork of LucidVR, targeting a slightly higher pricepoint of $200 per pair, and we're calling it [ClearGauntlets](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets). More on that later this year.
