Computers are hard and I don't understand them, so I went to RIT for five years. Now I know that computers are hard and I will never understand them, but at least now I have a few neat tricks™ I can do to convince them to do what I want.

These neat tricks mostly revolve around all systems of the embedded and distributed variety. Seriously, I have too many interests. I use computers, code, electronics, etc as a means to an end. Usually I think of a cool thing™ and then figure out what needs to happen to make that thing possible. 

When I'm not employing aforementioned Neat Tricks™, I'm probably playing DND, writing fiction, or being outside. I also know _just_ enough Spanish to be dangerous :)
