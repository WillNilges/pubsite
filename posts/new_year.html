    Hello, and happy new year!
</p>
<p>
    New year, new semester. I wanted to make a small blog post to get things rolling and announce two things that I'm doing/have done.
</p>
<p>
    For the last 6(?) months, I've been working on a thing called <a href="https://www.github.com/willnilges/shelflife">ShelfLife</a>, a OpenShift application that manages cluster resources by tracking project usage and automatically diverting resources away from stale pods and unused projects, eventually archiving them and deleting them off the cluster. The MVP for this app is done, and as soon as I figure out some API key nonsense, I'll have that up and running in a VM. Next steps with that are to create a web dashboard where people can retrieve their archived projects and restore them to the cluster, so that RTPs don't have to do it. After that, I want to containerize the application and add some more features so that it can run directly on the cluster instead of in a VM and be even more useful. After that's done, I'd like to write a second version in Go, and commit it directly, as a cluster feature, to the OpenShift repository on github.
    <br>
    So that's the plan on that.
</p>
<p>
    As for the second thing, I've undertaken an independent study this semester, working with these neat machines called OLPCs. Might've heard of these about 12 years back when they got deployed to developing countries to help kiddos learn. The full name of the project is the One Laptop Per Child project.

<p>
    It's been a passing interest of mine for a while, and the issue with them is that they're old. They don't run modern Linux, and I would like them to. So I'll be blogging about that in the coming months.
</p>
<p>
    Stay tuned, and follow Willard in his adventures to survive yet <em>another</em> semester of engineering school.
