# About Me

## Hi, I'm Willard (they/them)

---

Computer Engineer, Linux fanatic, OpenShift goblin, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I write a lot of code, stare at Datadog, swear at the command line, and put circuits
on boards. I work on all kinds of stuff, because being absurdly busy is the key
to happiness for me.

## What I'm working on

---

I'm currently employed as a backend programmer at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com),
working on some pipelines and datastores responsible for the metadata that powers
the metrics service.

In my spare time, I work on some software and infrastructure for [NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net).
