## Hi, I'm Willard (he/they)

---

Computer Engineer, Linux fanatic, OpenShift goblin, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I write a lot of code, stare at Datadog, swear at the command line, and put circuits on boards. I work on all kinds of stuff, a
 lot of whatever piques my interest at a given time. My current obsession is Virtual Reality, SteamVR and the LucidVR project.
A lot of my work can be found on the [ClearGauntlets](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets) GitHub and https://cleargauntlets.gith
ub.io.

## What I'm working on

---

I've just graduated from college! Working on finding an apartment in NYC so I can start working as a backend programmer at Data
dog! It's a dream come true. I only learned about Datadog in my 2nd year of college, but I've been fascinated by the world of D
evOps since I was 16, and getting to put that knowledge to use and get paid for it _really_ scratches that "I want to play with
 big computers" itch.
