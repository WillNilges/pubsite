## **Directional AC**

Directional AC is a project I worked on for Imagine RIT 2019 as part of
a bigger smart-car project made by CSH. The project helps to complete
our concept of the interior of a futuristic car we\'ve dubbed the
Computerized Autonomous Roadster (CAR). It involves enabling the fans in
a car\'s AC system to track a passenger and adjust its direction, power,
and temperature using a 3D-printed bracket and camera setup.

The project is currently capable of tracking a passenger\'s face
accurately and adjusting direction. I\'m going to continue work on it to
add more features and refine the bracket. Follow development
