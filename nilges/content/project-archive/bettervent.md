BetterVent is a scheduling app I am developing for Computer Science
House. We have tablets outside our special rooms that run this software.
It displays the current time, which event is currently taking place, and
which events are coming up. It also lets people make short, quick
reservations for if they need to snag a room for a bit. Check on its
progress and fork me

Bettervent is open source, and you can find my repo on GitHub. You can
also look at Reservator that I tried to fork from, but that app ended up
being an overengineered undocumented nightmare, so I tossed everything
out and started writing my own from scratch.\
\
Lately i\'ve gotten busy making quality-of-life improvements to the UI
and catching new and exciting bugs, but also adding the additional small
feature here and there. At this point, I\'d call BetterVent complete.
Check out the README for more information.
