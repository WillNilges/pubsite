## **BOA**

BOA is a Unity game that I am currently developing in C#. It\'s a
fast-paced, PVP, multiplayer shooter with a heavy focus on mobility and
reaction time that drew a lot of inspiration from Terraria and
OpenArena. Terraria PVP is a lot of fun in the 2D voxel-like
environments that comprise that game, but I\'d like it to be faster, and
more focused on the combat. OpenArena is a lot like that, and also
captures the general feel I want for the game.

I\'ve had to put it on hold for a while as I focus on school, work, and
my projects for CSH, but it\'ll (hopefully) be done by ~~mid 2019~~
~~2020™~~ ~~2021™™~~.
