# Talks

On occasion, I like to speak about my work. Here are links to some publicly available
talks I've given.

I introduce my new project for NYC Mesh, [Pano](https://github.com/willnilges/pano),
 a simple Flask API for uploading, storing, and retrieving panoramas.

Andrew Dickinson and I provide an update on [MeshDB's](https://github.com/nycmeshnet/meshdb)
