# Talks

On occasion, I like to speak about my work. Here are links to some publicly available
talks I've given.

## [Lessons Learned Building Observability for a Non-Profit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17hTXhArfXY)
### 2025-10-04

In October, I had the amazing opportunity to speak at [Texas Linux Fest 2025](https://2025.texaslinuxfest.org/talks/lessons-learned-building-observability-for-a-non-profit),
a conference for Linux and open source enthusiasts to meet and share ideas. I met
a bunch of really cool people while I was there, and learned a lot about some newer
trends in the Linux world such as bootc, project bluefin, and SteamOS.

My talk was about observability for NYC Mesh, a topic I am only lightly obsessed with.
In it, I give a quick overview of our network, risks to it, and the tools we use to
identify and diagnose issues.

development, roughly one month before the project goes live.
