How to set up networking on an uncooperative CLI

### 29 October, 2018

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, if you have something like a ThinkPad X380 Yoga (or like, any of the
newer, thiner ThinkPads) that has something like a proprietary Ethernet
port **or no network port at all** then here\'s how you set up
networking and get your hardware pinging the internet on a bare Ubuntu
(or not) install.

First, you need to add the device to

`/etc/network`

Add the device to your \`interfaces\` file which might look something
like this:

::: codeBlock
        # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
        # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
        source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
        # The loopback network interface
        auto lo
        iface lo inet loopback
:::

You will need to find the device name using

`ifconfig -a`

and then add the device to this like this:

`iface &ltDEVICE NAME> inet dhcp`

Then, you will need to hit it with an

`ifdown &ltDEVICE NAME>`

and then an

`ifup &ltDEVICE NAME>`

and then, assuming the divine forces will actually allow it, you should
be able to network!
