Here\'s a cool way to fix scaling and bad theme settings on GTK
applications like libreoffice. I figured this out on my XPS 9560 and now
I can use it again :P. Not sure if this can be done for every program,
but for GTK stuff it can, I guess. (BTW I\'m running i3)

Just shove this snippet into your .desktop file after the \`Exec=\`
(probably located somewhere around /usr/share/applications/), depending
on how you installed it. This\'ll change to a light theme (since they
actually work) and increase your scaling. Scaling level 2 is a little
big, but on a 4K display, I say too big is better than too small.

`env GTK_THEME=&ltany light theme in your .themes directory> GDK_SCALE=2`
