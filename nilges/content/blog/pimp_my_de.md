I recently gave a seminar on the basics of desktop environment (DE)
customization at Computer Science House. I discussed how to customize
your GNOME, KDE, and XFCE environments and where to get new themes,
icons, and fonts. The talk started with

**What is a DE?**

Desktop Environments are graphical interfaces that make it easier for
people to interface with computers. If you\'ve used a computer in the
last 20 years, you\'ve used a DE. DEs usually come with a window
manager, normally either floating (The windows can move around detached
from everything and will float over each other and behind each other) or
tiling (The windows take up the entire screen and typically can\'t
overlap except in tabbed mode). This allows you to multitask in an
easy-to-understand way. A DE also usually has \"widgets\" that let you
manage apps, power, wifi, sound, and desktop space more effectively.
Typically, a DE will have a dock or a task bar that will display running
processes as well as favorites, a system tray for getting info about
your network status, battery status, audio status, time, CPU load, disk
usage, RAM usage, and pretty much any other statistic you want about
your computer.

Finally, a DE will sometimes (depending on your install) have apps like
a graphical file manager, web browser, text editor, settings manager,
photo viewer, archiving tool, etc etc etc. that let users do command
line things on not the command line.

**Which DE should I use?**

The three most common DEs for newbies and experienced users alike are
GNOME, KDE, and XFCE.

**GNOME**

The one most newbies use because it comes with Ubuntu and Fedora by
default. It\'s simple (on the surface), pretty stable, and easy to learn
coming from Windows or macOS.

-   Already kinda pretty
-   Pretty good looking nowadays (it used to be hideous)
-   Uses plugins for customization
-   Heavy
-   Getting Lighter
-   Very actively developed (Since 1999)
-   Not good with older hardware

**KDE**

KDE is a nice DE that isn\'t as heavy as GNOME and operates similarly to
Windows, so it\'s good for those looking to transition. It customizes in
a very different way from GNOME, but it still has robust customization
options, utilizing modular and configurable panels that can be used in
almost any way. It\'s also actively developed by several different
communities.

-   Lighter weight(tm) than GNOME
-   Similar to Windows
-   REALLY good widget support
-   Actively developed (Since 1996)
-   Looks the most modern (arguably)
-   Sometimes weird theming

**XFCE**

XFCE is the lightest weight of these DEs. It\'s pretty old, too, and has
a smaller development team. It\'s highly configurable boasting a robust
and decently stable panel system. The panels work like KDE\'s panels,
but with more direct customization and fewer animations. If you want
your environment to look good without killing your CPU, this is the DE
for you.

-   Lightest weight (of the three here.)
-   Most customizable
-   Easiest to customize
-   Lots of small weird bugs
-   Old (Released in 1996)
-   Small dev team

Of course, there are others like i3, AwesomeWM, and Openbox, but those
can be difficult to configure, and were not covered in my seminar. So
that\'s about it for now. See ya!

Useful links:

For getting GNOME stuff: [gnome-look.org](http://gnome-look.org) and
[extensions.gnome.org](http://extensions.gnome.org). The former will get
you desktop themes, fonts, icons, and backgrounds, and the latter will
get you additional functionality like better window paneling, different
ways to manage desktops, widgets, dock customizations, and more.

For getting KDE stuff: You can use the \"Get more \" buttons in the
settings, or you can go to [kde-look.org](http://kde-look.org) to get
themes, fonts, icons, and more.

For getting XFCE stuff: You can go to, you guessed it,
[xfce-look.org](http://xfce-look.org). It\'s got all the things that the
other two sites I mentioned have.
