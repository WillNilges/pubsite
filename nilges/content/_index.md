# About this site

Hello there! Welcome to my tiny corner of tech knowledge.

Here, you will find miscellaneous tech advice, no-nonsense guides, absolute nonsense guides, and occasional notes that I write as I stumble my way through this-or-that project, issue, or other computing or electronics-related activity.

Additionally, I have some blurbs about what I'm working on in the "About Me" and "Project Archive" pages. You can also find my resume and links to my socials in the sidebar.

Please enjoy, and if you find anything I'm working on interesting, feel free to reach out!
