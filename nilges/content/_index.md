Hello! Welcome to my website.

I'm Willard Nilges (they/them): Computer Engineer, Linux Fanatic, DevOps goblin,
and Shiny Object Enthusiast. Here, you will find lots of opinions about technology,
no-nonsense guides, absolute nonsense guides, and occasional notes I write as I
stumble my way through this-or-that project, issue, or other computing or
electronics-related activity.

Additionally, I have some blurbs about what I'm working on in the "About Me" and
"Project Archive" pages. You can also find my resume and links to my socials in
the sidebar.

Please enjoy, and if you find anything I'm working on interesting, feel free to
reach out on Mastodon or LinkedIn (I check the former _substantially_ more than
I check the latter).
