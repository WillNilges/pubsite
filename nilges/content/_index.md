# About this site

Hello there! Welcome to my tiny corner of tech knowledge.

Here, you will find mostly miscellaneous tech advice, no-nonsense guides, and occasional notes that I write as I stumble my way through this-or-that project.

Additionally, I have some blurbs about what I'm working on in the "About Me" and "Project Archive" pages. You can also find my resume and links to my socials in the sidebar.
